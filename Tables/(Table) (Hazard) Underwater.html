<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p><b>Type: </b>Sapping Snow</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>Sapping Snow is what aquatic explorers call the powdery remains of dead organisms that cover the ocean floor. When this substance is imbued with necromantic magic, it becomes a life-leeching detritus.</p>
<p><b>Effect: </b>Whenever a creature starts its turn touching sapping snow, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 [[3d6]] necrotic damage. The creature's hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. If this effect reduces the creature's hit point maximum to 0, the creature dies, and its body immediately crumbles into sapping snow.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p><b>Type: </b>Lure Lights</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>When aboleths die, their souls sometimes gather in clusters called lure lights. These 100-foot-diameter collections of pale, yellow lights are found in the deep ocean below depths of 1,000 feet. They glow with bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light for another 100 feet.</p>
<p><b>Effect: </b>Any creature that can see the lure lights must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the lights for 24 hours or until the lights are destroyed. </p>
<p> A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the effect of the lure lights for 24 hours.  While charmed by the lights, a creature can't willingly move out of line of sight of them and defends them to the death. If forcibly moved away from the lights, the creature tries to find its way back to them. The creature can't take a short or long rest while under this effect. After 24 hours, the charmed creature gains one level of exhaustion and must repeat the saving throw if it is within line of sight of the lights, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the lights aren't within line of sight at this time, the creature succeeds automatically.  Each cluster of lure lights has AC 17, 100 hit points, and immunity to necrotic and poison damage.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p><b>Type: </b>Kraken's Grave</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>When krakens die, their bodies often rot on the seafloor. In such cases, the ground absorbs the decaying kraken's supernatural energy, marking the area with a dark stain in the shape of the kraken's body. This stain is called a kraken's grave.</p>
<p><b>Effect: </b>When a creature moves within 30 feet of a kraken's grave or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a <i> DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) </i> check or it disturbs the grave. </p><p> If a creature disturbs the grave, a tendril made of lightning stretches from the ground and attacks the creature with a [[1d20+7]] to hit. On a hit, the target takes [[3d6]] lightning damage, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for the next [[2d4]] hours.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p><b>Type: </b>Kelp Forest</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>Kelp grows in dense forests across the ocean floor. A kelp forest [[1d100]] ft. below the surface that is [[1d5280 * 10]] ft. long and [[1d5280 * 10]] ft. wide is discovered with kelp ranging from [[1d4 * 10]] to [[1d12 * 10 + 5]] ft. long.</p>
<p><b>Effect: </b>Kelp roots are shallow, and a whole forest can be uprooted by a strong storm. But it grows at a rapid pace, sometimes as much as 18 inches a day, meaning that a kelp forest can spring up quickly. Such forests can hide thousands of small fish and other prey animals, which attract predators. </p><p> The forest is so dense that anything within it is heavily obscured to an observer more than 10 feet away, and the whole area is difficult terrain.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p><b>Type: </b>Coral Reef</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>Coral reefs grow all over the ocean floor, though most are found within depths of less than 150 feet near the shoreline. A reef [[1d1000]] ft. long and [[1d1000]] ft. wide is discovered!</p>
<p><b>Effect: </b>These colorful ecosystems house small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. As a result, predators come to reefs looking for prey.  Uneven and sharp, coral reefs can harm those forced into them. A creature forcibly moved on the reef—without using the creature's action, bonus action, or reaction—takes 3 [[1d6]] slashing damage per 5 feet of reef that it is pushed over.</p>
